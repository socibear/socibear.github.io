HTML is a series of rules, almost like algebra that should be mastered with practice and a bit of memorization.  Understanding the theory and the logic would certainly be helpful but not critical.  And it seems like every kid I know who canâ€™t yet drive a car can write code like the wind.  HTML, CSS, C, C Plus, C Plus Minus and all the other languages I also know nothing about.</p>

	<p>Why no printed study notes?  Only those great videos featuring the dude with the hard to place accent.  Can I buy him a white board so he can write notes?  And save me from buying another guidebook?  And where did he cover Sublime?  I watched the videos and never heard him mention Sublime.  Not even sure how I figured out it was free text editor.  I got a lot things to whine about.  But that comes in the next entry.</p>
